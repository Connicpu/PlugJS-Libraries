A series of script files you can use with PlugJS for a scripted server experience you can edit on the fly

Download the plugin here https://bintray.com/version/show/files/connorcpu/PlugJS/PlugJS/1.0

Afterwards, place all of the files in this repo into ./plugins/PlugJS

If you do not have any permissions plugins with support for options installed, you
could get unexpected behaviours (working on that one)

If you don't have SpoutPlugin installed, be sure to comment out the bye_have_a_great_time.coffee library in plugin.js
